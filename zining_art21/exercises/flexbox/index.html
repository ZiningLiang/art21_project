Exercise: Flexbox Poster (Due on Monday, submit on Canvas)

Using Flexbox, create an online poster for a fictional event of your choosing. You must include:

- Title of event
- Date and time
- Location

Your poster should be responsive and change in some way when you resize the browser. Please use:


    - Flexbox – creating rows and columns, aligning items using `margin`. and/or CSS Grid – use CSS grid to help add structure to a series of elements.
    - Media Queries – your poster needs to be responsive and display properly on mobile devices, as well as desktop.
    - Positioning – some elements of your poster may require `absolute` positioning to achieve certain effects, such as overlapping elements.
    - Custom typography, please use 2 typefaces. Let’s continue leveling up our type skills!
