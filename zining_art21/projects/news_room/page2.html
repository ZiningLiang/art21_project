		<h2> Proplifting Journal - Quarantine Edition </h2>
		<a href="index.html">Back to cover page</a>
		<p> Hi, this is page 2 of the journal.</p>
		<p> I got inspired the other day to start proplifting again!</p>
		<p> I went to several local nurseries, Home Depot and Lowe's.</p>
		<p> After I went home, I started my new tray of pups in a egg carton that I fished out of the recycling bin.</p>
		<p> Mom and I also bought this gorgeous succulent hanging basket. I decided to proplift from this basket for my own garden as well.</p>
