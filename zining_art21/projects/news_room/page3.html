		<p> Hi, this is page 3 of the journal.</p>
		<p> Today I just want to share some progress that's going on at my prop station!</p>
		<p> I had transferred everything from the egg carton to this square pot and you can see this pink succulent leave already pushing out roots and tiny pups! This is so exciting :)</p>
