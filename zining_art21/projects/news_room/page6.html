		<h2> Proplifting Journal - Quarantine Edition </h2>
		<a href="index.html">Back to cover page</a>
		<p> Hi, this is page 6 of the journal.</p>
		<p> I found out about crochet planters at the farmers market the other day and they were so expensive! I decided to make my own instead and I found a great reference picture.</p>
		<p> After I finished the planter, I put a jellybean prop on top of it and hopefully it'll propagate soon.</p>
