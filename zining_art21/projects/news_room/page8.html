		<h2> Proplifting Journal - Quarantine Edition </h2>
		<a href="index.html">Back to cover page</a>
		<p> Hi, this is page 8 of the journal.</p>
		<p> Right after thanksgiving, I heard from mom that the gorgeous hanging basket of succulents we bought together back in the summer had died in the snow. She forgot to bring it back inside. </p>
		<p>I was very sad about it but fortunately, I prolifted from that basket! I have duplicates of the same plants that I could pop back into the same basket and revive it during this winter break! I am very glad about this and I might proplift all the plants I like just in case they might die from an accident like this.</p>
		<p>The basket might look very bare now but it is put under a grow light system and might spring back in a few months.</p>
