		<h2> Proplifting Journal - Quarantine Edition </h2>
		<a href="index.html">Back to cover page</a>
		<p> Hi, this is page 9 of the journal.</p>
		<p> Can't believe 2020 has already passed and it's a new year now.</p>
		<p>So my uncle tripped over my planter stand and broke my square pot full of prop babies and I had to go get new pots from Home Depot. Of course, I remembered to look for proplifts! I thought it's 2021 now and it's definitely a good time to restart the cycle of proplifts again!</p>
